# Movie Recommendation System

This project is a content-based Movie Recommendation System built with Python and Streamlit. It suggests movies similar to a selected title based on movie metadata and content similarity.

## Features

- Recommends top 5 similar movies for any selected movie.
- Displays movie posters using the TMDB API.
- Fast recommendations using precomputed similarity matrix.
- Interactive web interface built with Streamlit.

## Project Structure

- `app.py` — Streamlit web app for movie recommendations.
- `Movie Recomendation System .ipynb` — Jupyter notebook for data preprocessing and model building.
- `movies.pkl` — Pickled DataFrame containing processed movie metadata.
- `similarity.pkl` — Pickled similarity matrix for fast recommendations.
- `tmdb_5000_movies.csv` — Raw movie metadata.
- `tmdb_5000_credits.csv` — Raw movie credits data.

## How It Works

1. **Data Preparation:**  
   The notebook processes raw movie and credits data, extracts relevant features, and computes a similarity matrix using NLP techniques.

2. **Model:**  
   Uses CountVectorizer and cosine similarity to find similar movies based on genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overview.

3. **Web App:**  
   The Streamlit app loads the processed data and provides an interface for users to select a movie and view recommendations with posters.

## Setup & Usage

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn requests
   ```

2. **Run the app:**
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. **Open in browser:**  
   Go to the local URL provided by Streamlit to use the recommender.

## Data Sources

- [TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)

## Notes

- The TMDB API key used in `app.py` is for demonstration. For production, use your own API key.
- The pickled files (`movies.pkl`, `similarity.pkl`) are generated by running the notebook.
